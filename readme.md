## Python

### Basic Introduction to Python

#### Origin

Python is a programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was named after the British comedy group Monty Python. Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to read and write. It is also a general-purpose programming language that can be used for many different types of applications.

#### Features

Python is an interpreted language. This means that the code is not compiled into machine language before it is executed. Instead, the code is executed by an interpreter. The interpreter reads the code and executes it. Python is also an object-oriented programming language. This means that the code is organized into objects. These objects can contain data and code. Python is also a dynamically typed language. This means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

#### Program Structure

Python programs are organized into modules. A module is a file that contains Python code. Modules can be imported into other modules.

```python
import module_name  # This imports the module
```

Modules can also be executed directly.

```python
code:
    def function_name():
        print("Hello World")
    if __name__ == "__main__": # This is the main module
        function_name()
output:
    Hello World
```

Python programs are also organized into statements. A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. Statements are terminated by a newline character.

```python
print("Hello World")   # This is a statement
```

Python programs are also organized into blocks. A block is a section of code that is grouped together. Blocks are delimited by indentation.

```python
if True:        # This a block
    print("Hello World")
```
