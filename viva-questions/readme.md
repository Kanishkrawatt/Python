## What is the difference between lists and tuples ?

| Lists                                                                                      | Tuples                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lists are mutable , ie. They can be edited                                                 | Tuples are immutable (they are list that cannot be edited )                 |
| Lists are usually slower that tuples .                                                     | Tuples are faster than lists.                                               |
| Lists consume a lot of memory .                                                            | Tuples consumes less memory when compared to lists.                         |
| Lists are less reliable in terms of erros as unexpected changes are more likely to occur . | Tuples are more reliable as it is hard for any unexpected change to occur . |
| List consist of many built-in functions .                                                  | Tuples do not consist of any built-in functions .                           |
| Syntax : <br> List1 = [10,"hello",20]                                                           | Syntax : <br> Tup1 = (10,"hey",20)                                               |
