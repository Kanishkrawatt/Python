## What is Python ?

Python is a high level, interpreted , interactive , and object oriented scripting language. It uses English like keywords frequently.
Python is designed to be highly readable and compatible with different platform such as Mac, Windows , Linux , etc.

## Python is an interpreted Language . Explain ?

An interpreted language is any programming language that executes its statments line by line . Programs written in Python run directly from the source code , with no intermediary compilation Step.

## What is the difference between lists and tuples ?

| Lists                                                                                      | Tuples                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lists are mutable , ie. They can be edited                                                 | Tuples are immutable (they are list that cannot be edited )                 |
| Lists are usually slower that tuples .                                                     | Tuples are faster than lists.                                               |
| Lists consume a lot of memory .                                                            | Tuples consumes less memory when compared to lists.                         |
| Lists are less reliable in terms of erros as unexpected changes are more likely to occur . | Tuples are more reliable as it is hard for any unexpected change to occur . |
| List consist of many built-in functions .                                                  | Tuples do not consist of any built-in functions .                           |
| Syntax : <br> List1 = [10,"hello",20]                                                      | Syntax : <br> Tup1 = (10,"hey",20)                                          |

## What are the key features of Python ?

- Python is an interpreted language.
- Python is a dynamically typed language. (No need to specify the type of variable)
- Python is object oriented.
- Python is General purpose language.(It can be used for any purpose, be it web development, desktop application, game development, etc.)
- Python is cross platform language.(It can be used on any platform, be it Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)

### Built-in Modules

- Os
- Sys
- Math
- Random
- Datetime
  etc.

### Name Spaces

- Local
- Global
- Built-in

### Dictionary in Python

Python Dictionary is one of the supported data types in Python.It is an unordered collection of elements . The elements in dictionaries are stored as key-value pairs.Dictionaries are indexed by keys.

## What is **init** method in Python ?

The **init** method is a special method in Python classes. It is used to initialize the objects of a class. It is called when an object of a class is created. It is also called as a constructor in object oriented programming.

## What is **name** == "**main**" ?

The **name** variable is used to check whether the current file is being run directly or being imported from another module. If the file is being run directly, the **name** variable will be set to **main**.

## Difference between mutable and immutable objects ?

| Mutable Objects                                                                 | Immutable Objects                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutable objects can be changed after they are created.                          | Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created.                           |
| Mutable objects are slower than immutable objects.                              | Immutable objects are faster than mutable objects.                                    |
| Mutable objects consume more memory than immutable objects.                     | Immutable objects consume less memory than mutable objects.                           |
| Mutable objects are less reliable in terms of errors as unexpected changes are. | Immutable objects are more reliable as it is hard for any unexpected change to occur. |
| examples : <br> List , Dictionary , Number                                      | examples : <br> Tuple , String                                                        |

## What is the difference between list and dictionary ?

| List                                                                 | Dictionary                                                                 |

| List is slower than dictionary.                                        | Dictionary is faster than list.                                            |
| List consumes more memory than dictionary.                             | Dictionary consumes less memory than list.                                 |
